# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

The challenge was to optimize this online portfolio for <b>speed!</b>

## Challenge accepted!

1.  Get a score of 90 or above on Mobile and Desktop on [Page Speed insights.](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

How did I achieve this?

I used [npm as my build](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/) to minify my CSS and JavaScript, and optimize with [Webp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webp-bin), I wanted to try npm as a build tool, try something new.

After doing running one command, everything was done and I uploaded it to GitHub pages.

I haven't customized anything, I want to display the basic knowledge and put more energy towards my side projects and learning.

2. Have my page run at a smooth rate of 60fps.  WOW that's fast!

How did I achieve this?

I traveled on to [Jank free](jankfree.org), the re-paint of the DOM was because of the scrolling, so this article from [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/scrolling/) was my starting point, after getting that I knew that it was FAST, but I wanted faster!  So I animated the CSS class .mover cheaply with [transform](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/)


Thank you getting an insight to how I accomplished this project that is going towards my Udacity frontend nanodegree.
